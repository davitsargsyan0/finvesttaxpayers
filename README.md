# Foreign Investments and Taxpayer Institutions Growth in Armenia

## Overview
This project explores the relationship between **Foreign Direct Investments (FDI)** and the growth of taxpayer institutions in Armenia. Using statistical analysis and visualizations, it examines whether increased foreign investments correlate with the rise in new company registrations across sectors.

### Hypothesis
> "There is a positive correlation between foreign investments in an economic sector and the development of that sector, as measured by the number of new companies created annually in Armenia."
